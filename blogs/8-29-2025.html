        <p>After twelve days of dead ends, horrendous debugging, and yelling at the computer, the first Merux program has successfully been made.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Right now, all you can really do in it is just place bricks and watch them fall. And maybe get a few lag spikes here and then. Obviously, more features will be added in the future.</p>
