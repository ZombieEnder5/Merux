        <p>Goodness, those last two days were a nightmare.</p>
        <br />
        <p>During the last two days, I was trying to add a better Graphical User Interface (GUI). Basically, if you don't know what that is, think of the HUD you see in other games.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As easy as that may sound, it REALLY is not. With Google and Bing both becoming increasingly unhelpful, I eventually had to revamp the entire Game system.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, now it's done!</p>

        <br />
        <p>Expect the following features in the next update:</p>
        <br />
        <p>* An updating cursor.</p>
        <p>* Surface Snapping.</p>
        <p>* (MAYBE) A tool meant for dragging.</p>
