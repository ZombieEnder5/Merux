		<h1>Why I made this</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>I first joined Roblox in Mid 2016. When I first joined, I got a glimpse of the classic era of Roblox as it was fading away. I was in utter awe. Eight years later, I encountered a game on Roblox that allowed me to experience what the classic era of Roblox was like again. The further I went back, the more amazed I was at the simplicity of the environment. So, I decided to take on the challenging task of remaking what that era felt like.</p>
